/**
 * The screen an uncaught render or lifecycle throw lands on, mounted as the
 * catch-all route's `errorElement` in src/router.tsx. It replaces the whole
 * shell, so it has to stand alone: no sidebar, no header, no session — `useAuth`
 * lived in `App` and unmounted with it, and every order, ticket and count the
 * device held in memory went with it. A throw from an event handler does not
 * reach this screen; the boundary only covers rendering.
